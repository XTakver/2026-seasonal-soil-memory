# Roboto Condensed font files

These static `.ttf` files are included to ensure cross-platform, reproducible plot rendering (e.g., when exporting with CairoPDF).

They are registered at runtime by `initialize_font()` in `scripts/processing_functions/`.

Please keep the font license file in this directory.
