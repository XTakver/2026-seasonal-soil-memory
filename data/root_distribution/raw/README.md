# Raw input data (not tracked)

Place the raw root presence-absence/fraction file (`SP03902_v1.csv`) downloaded from the EDI data package in this folder.

This repository does **not** track raw data files. After placing the files here, run the root distribution workflow scripts in:
`scripts/root_distribution/` (01 → 02).

If you encounter “file not found” errors, confirm the filenames and paths match what the scripts expect.
