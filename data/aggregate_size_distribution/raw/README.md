# Raw input data (not tracked)

Place the raw Aggregate Size Distribution (ASD) file (`SP03901_v1.csv`) downloaded from the EDI data package in this folder.

This repository does **not** track raw data files. After placing the files here, run the ASD workflow scripts in:
`scripts/aggregate_size_distribution/` (01 → 03).

If you encounter “file not found” errors, confirm the filenames and paths match what the scripts expect.
